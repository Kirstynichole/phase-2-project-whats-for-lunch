Restaurants

# phase-2-project-whats-for-luch

Are you ever in the Financial District of NYC and wondering "What should I eat for lunch today?"

With the “What’s for lunch?” App, you’ll never have to stress about figuring out the answer to that question. 
This app uses a curated list of restaurants to make sure you always have a great lunch recommendation. 
It also allows you to review restaurants in the database that you’ve tried, and houses those reviews for your reference.

To build this app I used React, Tailwind, and Canva.
